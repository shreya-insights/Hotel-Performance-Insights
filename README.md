# Hotel Chain Insights

I developed a comprehensive project in Power BI, creating multiple interactive dashboards and tables to analyze hotel chain data. This process involved several stages, including data preprocessing, data cleaning, and data visualization.

## Dataset Used

- <a href="https://github.com/shreya-insights/Hotel-Performance-Insights/blob/main/input-files-1.zip">Hotel Chain (Raw Dataset)</a>

## KPIs

* *Revenue by Hotel:* Track overall revenue performance for each hotel in the chain.
* *Occupancy Rate by Hotel:* Measure the percentage of rooms occupied at each hotel.
* *Average Daily Rate (ADR):*  Analyze the average rate charged per occupied room per night.
* *Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR):*  Calculate a metric that considers both occupancy rate and ADR.
* *Guest Satisfaction:* Analyze guest reviews and feedback to understand satisfaction levels.
* *Booking Channel Performance:* Track the performance of different booking channels (e.g., direct bookings, online travel agencies).
* *Customer Segmentation:* Segment guests by demographics, preferences, and booking behavior to identify target markets.
* *Marketing Campaign Performance:* Measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns in driving bookings and revenue.

## Process

* Clean and pre-process data (reservations, guest information, revenue, etc.).
* Create dynamic filters based on hotel, date range, booking channel, and other relevant criteria.
* Visualize key metrics using bar charts, line graphs, and other charts for easy insights.
* Apply advanced analytics to identify trends and patterns across hotels and time periods.
* Enable interactive filtering for deep dives into specific subsets of the data.

## Processed Dataset

Since this data is confidential, it would not be shared in a report.

## Project Insights

* Analyze which hotels are performing well in terms of revenue, occupancy rate, and RevPAR.
* Identify any trends in guest satisfaction or booking channel performance.
* Segment guests to understand which demographics are most profitable or loyal.
* Measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns and identify areas for improvement.

## Final Conclusion

* Use the insights from the hotel chain data analysis to make data-driven decisions about resource allocation, marketing strategies, and property management.
* Focus on improving the performance of underperforming hotels.
* Develop targeted marketing campaigns to attract different guest segments.
* Continuously monitor and improve hotel chain performance based on data insights.
