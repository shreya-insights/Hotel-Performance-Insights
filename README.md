# Hotel Chain Insights

I developed a comprehensive project in Power BI, creating multiple interactive dashboards and tables to analyze hotel chain data. This process involved several stages, including data preprocessing, data cleaning, and data visualization.

## Dataset Used

- <a href="https://github.com/shreya-insights/Hotel-Performance-Insights/blob/main/input-files-1.zip">Hotel Chain (Raw Dataset)</a>

## KPIs

* *Revenue by Hotel:* Track overall revenue performance for each hotel in the chain.
* *Occupancy Rate by Hotel:* Measure the percentage of rooms occupied at each hotel.
* *Average Daily Rate (ADR):*  Analyze the average rate charged per occupied room per night.
* *Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR):*  Calculate a metric that considers both occupancy rate and ADR.
* *Guest Satisfaction:* Analyze guest reviews and feedback to understand satisfaction levels.
* *Booking Channel Performance:* Track the performance of different booking channels (e.g., direct bookings, online travel agencies).
* *Customer Segmentation:* Segment guests by demographics, preferences, and booking behavior to identify target markets.
* *Marketing Campaign Performance:* Measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns in driving bookings and revenue.

## Process

* Clean and pre-process data (reservations, guest information, revenue, etc.).
* Create dynamic filters based on hotel, date range, booking channel, and other relevant criteria.
* Visualize key metrics using bar charts, line graphs, and other charts for easy insights.
* Apply advanced analytics to identify trends and patterns across hotels and time periods.
* Enable interactive filtering for deep dives into specific subsets of the data.

## Processed Dataset

Since this data is confidential, it would not be shared in a report.

## Final Conclusion

* Weekend stays had 7% higher occupancy and better room rates than weekdays, suggesting a chance to raise prices on weekends.
* The 'direct online' platform gave the highest revenue efficiency (70.66%), while OTA platforms had lower returns, showing a need to promote direct bookings.
* Despite high Average Daily Rates (ADR), RevPAR remained low during some weeks, showing a gap between pricing and room usageâ€”pointing to poor inventory utilization.
* Business and Luxury room categories had almost equal occupancy, meaning marketing can target both segments equally for better reach.
* A direct link was found between low guest ratings and high cancellation rates, showing the impact of customer experience on revenue loss.
